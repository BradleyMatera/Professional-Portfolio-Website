## File Setup and Branch Management

1. **Initial Setup**: Used `create-react-app` for the initial setup.
2. **Branch Management**:
    - Main branch contains the core files and components.
    - Development branch used for implementing new features and components.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Start the development server using `npm start`.
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Development and Production

### Running the Development Server

To run the development server, use the following command:

```
npm start
```

This will start the development server and open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your default web browser. The development server automatically reloads the page whenever you make changes to the source files.

### Building for Production

To create a production build of the project, use the following command:

```
npm run build
```

This will generate an optimized and minified build of the project in the `build` directory. The production build is ready to be deployed to a web server.

### Serving the Production Build

To serve the production build locally, you can use the `serve` package. First, install `serve` globally if you haven't already:

```
npm install -g serve
```

Then, use the following command to serve the production build:

```
serve -s build
```

This will serve the production build at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).
